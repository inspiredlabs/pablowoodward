#### My life, in brief…

I was born Pablo Souza Santos and today I know little of my "first life" having, since my adoption aged not taller than a table, not returned to Brazil or reconnected with anyone from my former life in the orphanage, on the streets or wherever. With little or anyone to confirm their veracity, I confess my clouded confusion of reality wedged between dream and memory is just that: a mystery.  

Fluent in Portuguese only, walking, talking, joking, happy (as I recall) I was adopted by Alan Woodward, Stella Woodward and her son Richard Cotton to Luxembourg where I was showered with love and attention, introduced to lavishes I'd never dreamed of and so westernised so quickly in Luxembourg where I was flown to with my new identity of Pablo Woodward.  

Some three years later, having become fluent in English, we, as a family, moved to Gloucestershire, England where we lived in a mansion-sized farmhouse, with an orchard, goats, sheep, a tennis court, an incredible vegetable patch, with acres of land featuring a pond with ducks, chickens, geese; My Family and Other and The Good Life was how we lived sprinkled with a little Keeping Up Appearances.  

Aged twelve or so, with my parents, not brother, we moved to Dorset where I got schooled for the first time in the public school system, Sherborne Preparatory School and Sherborne School for Boys, where I lived in a regimented fashion with the privileged; a far cry from my first life.  

Looking back, my chosen profession in the arts was clear from a very early age, I used it as a form of escapism, and when the opportunity came I took it to immerse myself in all performance art related practices from doing school plays, to watching theatre, to watching films, to attending workshops, to leaving the public school system altogether to attend Yeovil College to do more career focused A Levels, in Performing Arts, Dance and French.  

Reflecting, my childhood was mentally turbulent, likely it was from being adopted at such a late age and therefor forever trying to find my identity, but it was at Yeovil College that I first grasped elusive happiness. In addition to my A Levels, as mentioned, in Performing arts and Dance, I did a BTEC diploma in Physical Education, did extra curricular classes in Latin American and ballroom dances, and whilst at college I was gifted the roles of Major Robbie Ross in Timberlake Wertenbaker's Our Country's Good and the title role in Anthony Burgess' superb lyrical translation of Cyrano de Bergerac.  

No sooner had I finished college, than I was working professionally, with my first role being in Chris Rea's music video Sweet Summers Day, then, before I knew it, I found myself touring panto across the UK and calling myself a jobbing actor.  

Not tempted by the first offers of formal training, on the second circuit of asking I was offered a place to train at London Academy of Dramatic Arts (LAMDA) and, principally for love, for I had met Jo Casci, I turned down the offer to study there, instead headed to Australia where I lived many lifetimes in many trades and father two children Rain Josephine and Indiana Rain.  

I confess, during this period, artistically I did not flourish and as a result I upskilled in various fields, becoming a worldly person with an impressive CV putting shame to many a jack of all trades. In brief, I called myself an entrepreneur running businesses in parties and events, in tennis and multi-sports tuition, as an English tutor, and I even established a quiz business, and that’s not including the numerous odd contract-jobs between auditions and between the odd performance related job in the entertainment industry.  

Feeling the unhappiness of the lack of work in the entertainment industry, the breakdown of my near nine-year relationship, and a general loss of my mojo, I headed alone to the United Kingdom with a dream to reclaim my life and fulfil my potential, only to meet my life love Lorena Alvarez with whom I had a profound life changing/direction defining and insightful experience/relationship.  

I yo-yo’d, destroyed our relationship, others too, and returned to Australia for what I now see as the darkest year of my life in which everything fell apart and I hit the bottom.  

With nowhere to go I made a conscious choice to follow my heart, soul, instinct and dream. Dream Big. Dream Again. Dream Like I used to.  

In late 2012, I returned to London and began to immerse myself full-time into my craft, something I admit not having done for a near ten years, this time driven by fear, hunger and passion to change the circumstances of my life and recover the 'lost' time.  

I worked, trained, became proactive, and my CV filled with credits in opera, commercials, TIE, short films, immersive jobs, corporate jobs; I became a successful jobbing actor once more.  

The next major chameleonic change in the life of Pablo Woodward came soon after the contract with Glyndebourne Opera in January 2016, when I simply needed to accelerate progress in all areas of personal development, to stop blaming my present situation on my past and ever dreaming of the future in patient hope for the life-changing opportunity to come…. That’s when I decided to be The Disco Bunny.  

Now, having found my calling and defined my mission, vision and dream with what I want to do with my time and energy on a humanitarian basis, I return to work as the artist Pablo Woodward.
